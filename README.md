Challenge 6 Api recollection

In this project the objective is to connect the api and make it work, without sharing the code. 


It divides into 2 main files, weather, and Vacation with a few files created from the files. 
This files are inside the folder WeatherPY including the CSV with the corresponding information. 


The Weather maps works and generate the file of the database as it should. 

In several attempts I had trouble with Geoapify, to obtain the hotels, around, it is not an easy api to work with, reading the files helped, but not that much. 


Sources for the files where videos, finish files and chat gpt.
